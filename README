Ponderbot.py
============

A bot for letting UCI chess engines play on FICS, written in Python.


Usage
-----

Configure the bot by changing CONFIGURATION VALUES at the beginning of the file. You may want to specify:

 - ENGINE: path to the engine binary.
 - OPERATOR: FICS handle (nick) of the operator, allowed to give commands to the engine through tells.
 - TIMESEAL: Path to the timeseal binary. For instance, ./zseal
 - SEEKS: three possible seek parameters, to be sent by the engine upon login and after every game's end.
 - HASH: if supported by the engine.
 - PONDER: whether or not let the engine think during oponnent's time.
 - AUTOACCEPT: whether or not to accept every challenge received.
 - RESTART_ON_NEW: wheter or not restart the engine after every match.
 - QUIT_ON_LOSE: whether or no quit after losing (useful for debugging purposes).
 - DEFAULT ANSWER: polite answer to be sent to players when they attempt to chat.
 - IGNORE: players whose tells will be ignored.
 - LOGIN_SCRIPT: series of commands to be sent to the server upon login. The first line should be the engine's FICS handle. To play as guest, just leave it as "g". The second line should be the account's password (plain text for now...).
 
Once logged in, the OPERATOR (and only him) may send commands to the engine by preceding tells with '!', such as: "tell <engine_handle> !command". Some examples:

	tell Claudiae !unseek
	tell Claudiae !seek 15 15 r f
	tell Claudiae !quit
